# Solution Steps

1. 1. Implement improved chunking: add both overlapping and semantic-boundary chunking methods, allowing for attaching per-chunk metadata. (chunking.py)

2. 2. Set up an embedding component using a quality sentence embedding model like SentenceTransformer. (embedding.py)

3. 3. Design and refactor the retrieval logic to accept top-k, distance metric choice, metadata filtering, and batch queries. Output must be compatible with ChromaDB or Pinecone and fallback to dummy interface for demo. Include optional reranking. (retrieval.py)

4. 4. Build a context manager to assemble as much retrieved text as can fit in a token budget, and apply clear delimiters. (context_builder.py)

5. 5. Define prompt engineering logic that injects instructions, in-context examples, retrieved context, and delineates the LLM's completion slot. (prompting.py)

6. 6. Provide evaluation utilities: recall@k, precision@k, latency measurement, and manual review logging. (evaluation.py)

7. 7. Wire everything together in main.py: prep and process sample data, index and embed, run retrieval (with metadata filtering), context construction, and prompt assembly. Demonstrate with the given queries, and print results.

8. 8. Add demonstration of at least two retrieval failure cases: (1) context dilution (mitigate via reranking/top-k/metadata filter), (2) no answer due to filter (mitigate via fallback/hybrid search logic), and document the fix inline.

9. 9. Ensure end-to-end demonstration, comments, and logging for spot checking (runlog.txt).
